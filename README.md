# Luigi's Math Adventure
An educational game I decided to create in my spare time. 

## Downloading the game
	- Run 'git clone https://briansukhnandan@bitbucket.org/briansukhnandan/luigis-math-adventure.git' in a Bash shell

## To run on Windows: 
	- Navigate to LMA/Windows_Release/ 
	- Run LMA.exe 

## To run on Linux (tested with Ubuntu 18.04/Manjaro XFCE): 
		- Navigate to LMA/Linux_Release and open a terminal 
		- Run 'chmod +x Launcher.x86_64' (Marks Launcher.x86_64 as an executable file) 
		- Run './Launcher.x86_64'
