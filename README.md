# Luigi's Math Adventure
An educational game I decided to create in my spare time.

- To run on Windows: 
		- Navigate to LMA/Windows_Release/ 
		- Run LMA.exe

- To run on Linux (tested with Ubuntu 18.04/Manjaro XFCE): 
		- Navigate to LMA/Linux_Release and open a terminal
		- Run 'chmod +x Launcher.x86_64' (Marks Launcher.x86_64 as an executable file)
		- Run './Launcher.x86_64'
