# Luigi's Math Adventure
An educational game I decided to create in my spare time. <br />

## To run on Windows: 
	- Navigate to LMA/Windows_Release/ <br />
	- Run LMA.exe <br />

## To run on Linux (tested with Ubuntu 18.04/Manjaro XFCE): 
		- Navigate to LMA/Linux_Release and open a terminal <br />
		- Run 'chmod +x Launcher.x86_64' (Marks Launcher.x86_64 as an executable file) <br />
		- Run './Launcher.x86_64' <br />
